        username lore (I added this just because i got asked for the reasoning of my username like 8 times): 
        - "The™️" is just a prefix i took from "**The™️** Hideout" (a groupchat i am in),
        the "™️" after "The" originated from of us not knowing what to name our server so we all just had an argument
        and i started to place the trademark symbol as "The Hideout™️" but someone missplaced it and it came out as "The™️ Hideout"
        - and "J" also originates from "The™️ Hideout", people there didnt know how to pronounce my earlier nickname ("Jankeczek"), so they jokingly asked me to change the nickname to "J",
        so i firstly jokingly set my nickname to "J" and then i rolled with it and it evolved to "The™️ J"
        - thing, as "Jankeczek" comes from my guy-name you can make the abbreviation that it comes from "maja"/"majka"/"majcia" and thet "the m" and "the a" didnt stick to me. Though i dont have a big of a problem with my guy-name, at least not now
