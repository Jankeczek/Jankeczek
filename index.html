        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>Haii !!! Welcome to my website !!!</p>

        <h2>Who are you??</h2>
        <p>I'm glad you asked, I'm J, tho you can call me Maja, I'm a bisexual trans girl (she/her) aaand I'm from Poland [who would've guessed]</p>
        <p><ul>As every trans girl that exists, I like programming, out of all the programming languagaes, I'm currently learning:</p>
        (sarcastical ^)

            <li> GDScript (Godot, Hobby)                                </li>
            <li> Python (School)                                        </li>
            <li> C (Arduino, School)                                    </li>
            <li> C++ (School)                                           </li>
            <li> ~~C#~~ (discontinued as i dont use Unity anymore)      </li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2><ul>Ok, that's cool and all, but where did "The™️ J" nickname come from?</h2>
        (I added this just because i got asked for the reasoning of my username like 8 times): 
            
            <li> "The™️" is just a prefix i took from "**The™️** Hideout" (a groupchat i am in), the "™️" after "The" originated from of us not knowing what to name our server so we all just had an argument and i started to place the trademark symbol as "The Hideout™️" but someone missplaced it and it came out as "The™️ Hideout"   </li>
            <li> and "J" also originates from "The™️ Hideout", people there didnt know how to pronounce my earlier nickname ("Jankeczek"), so they jokingly asked me to change the nickname to "J",  so i firstly jokingly set my nickname to "J" and then i rolled with it and it evolved to "The™️ J"                                   </li>
            <li> thing, as "Jankeczek" comes from my guy-name you can make the abbreviation that it comes from "maja"/"majka"/"majcia" and thet "the m" and "the a" didnt stick to me. Though i dont have a big of a problem with my guy-name, at least not now                                                                         </li>

        </ul>
