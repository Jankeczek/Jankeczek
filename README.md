me username lore:
- "The™️" is just a prefix i took from "**The™️** Hideout" (a groupchat i *was* in),
it originated because all of us didnt know what to name our server so we all just had an argument
and i started to place the trademark symbol as "The Hideout™️" but someone missplaced it and it came out as "The™️ Hideout"
- and "J" also originates from "The™️ Hideout", people there didnt know how to pronounce my earlier nickname,
which was "Janeczek" and "Janeczek" is basically a cuter version of my real name, "Jan", so they jokingly asked me to change the nickname to "J",
so i firstly jokingly set my nickname to "J" and then i went with that and it evolved to "The™️ J"
